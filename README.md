The Force Field Toolkit is comprised of a set of tools that aid users in the development of CHARMM-compatible forcefield parameters, including charges, bonds, angles, and dihedrals. These tools are accessed through the provided GUI, which greatly simplifies the setup and analysis of the underlying calculations. Amber-compatible parameters can also be generated, although Amber-style force field files are not output (users can convert though with parmed). FFTK is a plugin of the molecular visualization and analysis program, VMD. More details, including papers, tutorials, etc., can be found here: https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/plugins/fftk/
